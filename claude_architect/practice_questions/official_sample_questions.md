## Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent

**Q1.** Production data shows that in 12% of cases, your agent skips `get_customer`
entirely and calls `lookup_order` using only the customer's stated name, occasionally
leading to misidentified accounts and incorrect refunds. What change would most
effectively address this reliability issue?

A) Add a programmatic prerequisite that blocks `lookup_order` and `process_refund`
calls until `get_customer` has returned a verified customer ID.

B) Enhance the system prompt to state that customer verification via `get_customer`
is mandatory before any order operations.

C) Add few-shot examples showing the agent always calling `get_customer` first,
even when customers volunteer order details.

D) Implement a routing classifier that analyzes each request and enables only the
subset of tools appropriate for that request type.

**✅ Correct Answer: A**

> When a specific tool sequence is required for critical business logic (like verifying
> customer identity before processing refunds), programmatic enforcement provides
> deterministic guarantees that prompt-based approaches cannot. Options B and C rely on
> probabilistic LLM compliance, which is insufficient when errors have financial
> consequences. Option D addresses tool availability rather than tool ordering, which is
> not the actual problem.

---

**Q2.** Production logs show the agent frequently calls `get_customer` when users ask
about orders (e.g., "check my order #12345"), instead of calling `lookup_order`. Both
tools have minimal descriptions ("Retrieves customer information" / "Retrieves order
details") and accept similar identifier formats. What's the most effective first step to
improve tool selection reliability?

A) Add few-shot examples to the system prompt demonstrating correct tool selection
patterns, with 5-8 examples showing order-related queries routing to `lookup_order`.

B) Expand each tool's description to include input formats it handles, example queries,
edge cases, and boundaries explaining when to use it versus similar tools.

C) Implement a routing layer that parses user input before each turn and pre-selects the
appropriate tool based on detected keywords and identifier patterns.

D) Consolidate both tools into a single `lookup_entity` tool that accepts any identifier
and internally determines which backend to query.

**✅ Correct Answer: B**

> Tool descriptions are the primary mechanism LLMs use for tool selection. When
> descriptions are minimal, models lack the context to differentiate between similar tools.
> Option B directly addresses this root cause with a low-effort, high-leverage fix.
> Few-shot examples (A) add token overhead without fixing the underlying issue. A routing
> layer (C) is over-engineered and bypasses the LLM's natural language understanding.
> Consolidating tools (D) is a valid architectural choice but requires more effort than a
> "first step" warrants when the immediate problem is inadequate descriptions.

---

**Q3.** Your agent achieves 55% first-contact resolution, well below the 80% target.
Logs show it escalates straightforward cases (standard damage replacements with photo
evidence) while attempting to autonomously handle complex situations requiring policy
exceptions. What's the most effective way to improve escalation calibration?

A) Add explicit escalation criteria to your system prompt with few-shot examples
demonstrating when to escalate versus resolve autonomously.

B) Have the agent self-report a confidence score (1-10) before each response and
automatically route requests to humans when confidence falls below a threshold.

C) Deploy a separate classifier model trained on historical tickets to predict which
requests need escalation before the main agent begins processing.

D) Implement sentiment analysis to detect customer frustration levels and automatically
escalate when negative sentiment exceeds a threshold.

**✅ Correct Answer: A**

> Adding explicit escalation criteria with few-shot examples directly addresses the root
> cause: unclear decision boundaries. This is the proportionate first response before
> adding infrastructure. Option B fails because LLM self-reported confidence is poorly
> calibrated — the agent is already incorrectly confident on hard cases. Option C is
> over-engineered, requiring labeled data and ML infrastructure when prompt optimization
> hasn't been tried. Option D solves a different problem entirely; sentiment doesn't
> correlate with case complexity, which is the actual issue.

## Scenario: Code Generation with Claude Code

**Q4.** You want to create a custom `/review` slash command that runs your team's
standard code review checklist. This command should be available to every developer
when they clone or pull the repository. Where should you create this command file?

A) In the `.claude/commands/` directory in the project repository

B) In `~/.claude/commands/` in each developer's home directory

C) In the `CLAUDE.md` file at the project root

D) In a `.claude/config.json` file with a `commands` array

**✅ Correct Answer: A**

> Project-scoped custom slash commands should be stored in the `.claude/commands/`
> directory within the repository. These commands are version-controlled and
> automatically available to all developers when they clone or pull the repo.
> Option B (`~/.claude/commands/`) is for personal commands that aren't shared via
> version control. Option C (CLAUDE.md) is for project instructions and context, not
> command definitions. Option D describes a configuration mechanism that doesn't exist
> in Claude Code.

---

**Q5.** You've been assigned to restructure the team's monolithic application into
microservices. This will involve changes across dozens of files and requires decisions
about service boundaries and module dependencies. Which approach should you take?

A) Enter plan mode to explore the codebase, understand dependencies, and design an
implementation approach before making changes.

B) Start with direct execution and make changes incrementally, letting the
implementation reveal the natural service boundaries.

C) Use direct execution with comprehensive upfront instructions detailing exactly how
each service should be structured.

D) Begin in direct execution mode and only switch to plan mode if you encounter
unexpected complexity during implementation.

**✅ Correct Answer: A**

> Plan mode is designed for complex tasks involving large-scale changes, multiple valid
> approaches, and architectural decisions — exactly what monolith-to-microservices
> restructuring requires. It enables safe codebase exploration and design before
> committing to changes. Option B risks costly rework when dependencies are discovered
> late. Option C assumes you already know the right structure without exploring the code.
> Option D ignores that the complexity is already stated in the requirements, not
> something that might emerge later.

---

**Q6.** Your codebase has distinct areas with different coding conventions: React
components use functional style with hooks, API handlers use async/await with specific
error handling, and database models follow a repository pattern. Test files are spread
throughout the codebase alongside the code they test (e.g., `Button.test.tsx` next to
`Button.tsx`), and you want all tests to follow the same conventions regardless of
location. What's the most maintainable way to ensure Claude automatically applies the
correct conventions when generating code?

A) Create rule files in `.claude/rules/` with YAML frontmatter specifying glob patterns
to conditionally apply conventions based on file paths.

B) Consolidate all conventions in the root `CLAUDE.md` file under headers for each area,
relying on Claude to infer which section applies.

C) Create skills in `.claude/skills/` for each code type that include the relevant
conventions in their `SKILL.md` files.

D) Place a separate `CLAUDE.md` file in each subdirectory containing that area's
specific conventions.

**✅ Correct Answer: A**

> `.claude/rules/` with glob patterns (e.g., `**/*.test.tsx`) allows conventions to be
> automatically applied based on file paths regardless of directory location — essential
> for test files spread throughout the codebase. Option B relies on inference rather than
> explicit matching, making it unreliable. Option C requires manual skill invocation or
> relies on Claude choosing to load them, contradicting the need for deterministic
> "automatic" application based on file paths. Option D can't easily handle files spread
> across many directories since CLAUDE.md files are directory-bound.

## Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System

**Q7.** After running the system on the topic "impact of AI on creative industries," you
observe that each subagent completes successfully: the web search agent finds relevant
articles, the document analysis agent summarizes papers correctly, and the synthesis
agent produces coherent output. However, the final reports cover only visual arts,
completely missing music, writing, and film production. When you examine the
coordinator's logs, you see it decomposed the topic into three subtasks: "AI in digital
art creation," "AI in graphic design," and "AI in photography." What is the most likely
root cause?

A) The synthesis agent lacks instructions for identifying coverage gaps in the findings it
receives from other agents.

B) The coordinator agent's task decomposition is too narrow, resulting in subagent
assignments that don't cover all relevant domains of the topic.

C) The web search agent's queries are not comprehensive enough and need to be
expanded to cover more creative industry sectors.

D) The document analysis agent is filtering out sources related to non-visual creative
industries due to overly restrictive relevance criteria.

**✅ Correct Answer: B**

> The coordinator's logs reveal the root cause directly: it decomposed "creative
> industries" into only visual arts subtasks (digital art, graphic design, photography),
> completely omitting music, writing, and film. The subagents executed their assigned
> tasks correctly — the problem is what they were assigned. Options A, C, and D
> incorrectly blame downstream agents that are working correctly within their assigned
> scope.

---

**Q8.** The web search subagent times out while researching a complex topic. You need
to design how this failure information flows back to the coordinator agent. Which error
propagation approach best enables intelligent recovery?

A) Return structured error context to the coordinator including the failure type, the
attempted query, any partial results, and potential alternative approaches.

B) Implement automatic retry logic with exponential backoff within the subagent,
returning a generic "search unavailable" status only after all retries are exhausted.

C) Catch the timeout within the subagent and return an empty result set marked as
successful.

D) Propagate the timeout exception directly to a top-level handler that terminates the
entire research workflow.

**✅ Correct Answer: A**

> Structured error context gives the coordinator the information it needs to make
> intelligent recovery decisions — whether to retry with a modified query, try an
> alternative approach, or proceed with partial results. Option B's generic status hides
> valuable context from the coordinator, preventing informed decisions. Option C
> suppresses the error by marking failure as success, which prevents any recovery and
> risks incomplete research outputs. Option D terminates the entire workflow
> unnecessarily when recovery strategies could succeed.

---

**Q9.** During testing, you observe that the synthesis agent frequently needs to verify
specific claims while combining findings. Currently, when verification is needed, the
synthesis agent returns control to the coordinator, which invokes the web search agent,
then re-invokes synthesis with results. This adds 2-3 round trips per task and increases
latency by 40%. Your evaluation shows that 85% of these verifications are simple
fact-checks (dates, names, statistics) while 15% require deeper investigation. What's
the most effective approach to reduce overhead while maintaining system reliability?

A) Give the synthesis agent a scoped `verify_fact` tool for simple lookups, while complex
verifications continue delegating to the web search agent through the coordinator.

B) Have the synthesis agent accumulate all verification needs and return them as a batch
to the coordinator at the end of its pass, which then sends them all to the web search
agent at once.

C) Give the synthesis agent access to all web search tools so it can handle any
verification need directly without round-trips through the coordinator.

D) Have the web search agent proactively cache extra context around each source during
initial research, anticipating what the synthesis agent might need to verify.

**✅ Correct Answer: A**

> Option A applies the principle of least privilege by giving the synthesis agent only what
> it needs for the 85% common case (simple fact verification) while preserving the
> existing coordination pattern for complex cases. Option B's batching approach creates
> blocking dependencies since synthesis steps may depend on earlier verified facts.
> Option C over-provisions the synthesis agent, violating separation of concerns.
> Option D relies on speculative caching that cannot reliably predict what the synthesis
> agent will need to verify.

## Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration

**Q10.** Your pipeline script runs `claude "Analyze this pull request for security issues"`
but the job hangs indefinitely. Logs indicate Claude Code is waiting for interactive input.
What's the correct approach to run Claude Code in an automated pipeline?

A) Add the `-p` flag: `claude -p "Analyze this pull request for security issues"`

B) Set the environment variable `CLAUDE_HEADLESS=true` before running the command

C) Redirect stdin from `/dev/null`:
`claude "Analyze this pull request for security issues" < /dev/null`

D) Add the `--batch` flag:
`claude --batch "Analyze this pull request for security issues"`

**✅ Correct Answer: A**

> The `-p` (or `--print`) flag is the documented way to run Claude Code in
> non-interactive mode. It processes the prompt, outputs the result to stdout, and exits
> without waiting for user input — exactly what CI/CD pipelines require. The other
> options reference non-existent features (`CLAUDE_HEADLESS` environment variable,
> `--batch` flag) or use Unix workarounds that don't properly address Claude Code's
> command syntax.

**Q11.** Your team wants to reduce API costs for automated analysis. Currently, real-time
Claude calls power two workflows: (1) a blocking pre-merge check that must complete
before developers can merge, and (2) a technical debt report generated overnight for
review the next morning. Your manager proposes switching both to the Message Batches
API for its 50% cost savings. How should you evaluate this proposal?

A) Use batch processing for the technical debt reports only; keep real-time calls for
pre-merge checks.

B) Switch both workflows to batch processing with status polling to check for
completion.

C) Keep real-time calls for both workflows to avoid batch result ordering issues.

D) Switch both to batch processing with a timeout fallback to real-time if batches take
too long.

**✅ Correct Answer: A**

> The Message Batches API offers 50% cost savings but has processing times up to
> 24 hours with no guaranteed latency SLA. This makes it unsuitable for blocking
> pre-merge checks where developers wait for results, but ideal for overnight batch jobs
> like technical debt reports. Option B is wrong because relying on "often faster"
> completion isn't acceptable for blocking workflows. Option C reflects a
> misconception — batch results can be correlated using `custom_id` fields. Option D
> adds unnecessary complexity when the simpler solution is matching each API to its
> appropriate use case.

---

**Q12.** A pull request modifies 14 files across the stock tracking module. Your
single-pass review analyzing all files together produces inconsistent results: detailed
feedback for some files but superficial comments for others, obvious bugs missed, and
contradictory feedback — flagging a pattern as problematic in one file while approving
identical code elsewhere in the same PR. How should you restructure the review?

A) Split into focused passes: analyze each file individually for local issues, then run a
separate integration-focused pass examining cross-file data flow.

B) Require developers to split large PRs into smaller submissions of 3-4 files before the
automated review runs.

C) Switch to a higher-tier model with a larger context window to give all 14 files
adequate attention in one pass.

D) Run three independent review passes on the full PR and only flag issues that appear
in at least two of the three runs.

**✅ Correct Answer: A**

> Splitting reviews into focused passes directly addresses the root cause: attention
> dilution when processing many files at once. File-by-file analysis ensures consistent
> depth, while a separate integration pass catches cross-file issues. Option B shifts
> burden to developers without improving the system. Option C misunderstands that
> larger context windows don't solve attention quality issues. Option D would actually
> suppress detection of real bugs by requiring consensus on issues that may only be
> caught intermittently.

## What These Questions Reveal About the Exam

**Pattern 1: Root cause, not symptom**
Every question requires identifying the actual root cause. Q7 is the clearest example —
all subagents "completed successfully" but the coordinator's decomposition was wrong.
Blame the right component.

**Pattern 2: Programmatic enforcement beats prompts for compliance**
Q1 and Q3 both test this. When financial consequences or reliability requirements
exist, prompt instructions are never the answer.

**Pattern 3: Proportionate first step**
Q2 and Q3 specifically test whether you choose the right-sized intervention. Q2's
answer is "fix the descriptions" not "build a routing layer." Q3's answer is "fix the
prompt" not "build a classifier." The exam rewards proportionate responses.

**Pattern 4: Tool descriptions are the LLM's primary navigation signal**
Q2 makes this explicit. When tools misbehave, check descriptions first.

**Pattern 5: Batch API = latency-tolerant workloads only**
Q11 is a clean test of this. Never batch a blocking workflow regardless of cost savings.

**Pattern 6: Per-file + integration pass = multi-file review architecture**
Q12 tests this directly. Larger models don't fix attention dilution — better architecture does.
